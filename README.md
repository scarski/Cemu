You'll need to start a new game since my save is on there. 
Steps to run cemu:
1. Launch MapleSeed2
2. cemu directory is in the main file of the folder and the game location is located here: C:\Users\scars\Desktop\cemu_1.7.4d\The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild (1.33)\code\U-King.rpx (this will also be the file you select when cemu starts up)
3. once you do that the mapleseed app will have a drop down menu at the bottom, select the resolution you want to play at
4. right above that there's an option to launch cemu, click it
5. wait for the shaders to compile (this might takea  while)
6. the game should load automatically but if it doesnt load from there click file-load- and follow the directory above for Zelda
7. Enjoy!
